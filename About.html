    <div class= "abouttxt">
      <p>I've worn many hats when it comes to running a small business in high school and college, writing for a surf magazine, and producing a documentary.
        <br />  <br />I grew up wanting to figure things out for myself and never took interest in just one thing.
        However, I recently taught myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript and now work as a freelance web developer.
        <br />  <br />I recently graduated with degrees in Entrepreneurship and French from Loyola Marymount University and spent a year working in France right out of college.
        Currently, Iâ€™m based in San Diego, California but travel as much as I can, usually to new surf destinations.
        <br />  <br />Some other things I like - cooking over a campfire, permaculture, motorcycles, and all things self-reliance.</p>
