    <div class= "abouttxt">
      <p>I've worn many hats when it comes to running a small business in high school, writing for a surf magazine, taking photos, and producing a documentary.<br /><br />
         The thread connecting these experiences is my love for being outside and capturing the places I've been and the people I've met.<br /><br />
         I grew up wanting to figure things out for myself and never took interest in just one thing. However, I am deeply connected to my French heritage and decided to major in French Language along with Entrepreneurship at Loyola Marymount University.<br /><br />
         My studies provided a good foundation for the course I've embarked on. Directly after graduation I decided to move to France, and I worked at the Patagonia store in Chamonix, France for 6 months. <br /><br />
         On the side, I taught myself how to code and build websites.<br /> <br />
         I left home with only a backpack, camera, and surfboard. More recently I acquired a pair of touring skis and a bit of climbing gear.
         I feel my best when I own the least amount of things, so I'm always trying to downsize. <br /><br />
         Some other things I like - cooking over a campfire, literature, motorcycles, painting, environmentalism, and all things self-reliance. </p>
